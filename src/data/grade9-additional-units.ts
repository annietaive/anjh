After the government had introduced the Doi Moi reforms in 1986, everything began to change. By 1995, Vietnam had opened diplomatic relations with the United States. By the time Vietnam joined the WTO in 2007, it had already become an attractive destination for foreign investment. Cities have transformed completely. Ho Chi Minh City, which had been relatively undeveloped in the 1990s, is now a modern metropolis with skyscrapers and advanced infrastructure. Before 2000, few Vietnamese had motorcycles. Now, they are everywhere. The economy has grown impressively. By 2020, Vietnam had become a middle-income country. Living standards have improved significantly.

Most people had worked in agriculture and earned little money. By the time the 2000s arrived, cities had already started developing rapidly. When I compare old photos with today, the difference is striking. Before, Hanoi had few tall buildings. Now, modern skyscrapers dominate the skyline. Transportation has improved dramatically. Before the metro system was built, traffic congestion had been terrible. Now, with new infrastructure, getting around is easier. Technology has transformed daily life. Before smartphones became popular, people had communicated mainly through landlines or in person. Now, everyone uses mobile devices and social media. Education has also advanced. My parents said that before they had gone to university, few people had received higher education. Today, many students attend universities. Living standards have risen. People who had struggled with poverty now have better opportunities. However, some things remain unchanged - Vietnamese family values and culture are still strong.

      title: "Ho Chi Minh City's Development",
      passage: "Ho Chi Minh City, formerly known as Saigon, has experienced extraordinary development. Before 1975, Saigon had been the capital of South Vietnam and a bustling commercial center. After reunification, it had faced economic challenges during the subsidy period. However, after the government had implemented Doi Moi reforms, the city began its transformation. By 1995, foreign companies had already started investing heavily. The skyline has changed dramatically. Before 2000, the city had few high-rise buildings. The tallest structure had been the old Saigon Trade Center. Now, Bitexco Financial Tower, Landmark 81, and many other skyscrapers define the cityscape. Landmark 81, completed in 2018, is the tallest building in Vietnam and Southeast Asia. Infrastructure has improved significantly. Before modern roads and bridges had been built, traffic congestion had been nightmarish. Now, numerous flyovers, tunnels, and wider roads help traffic flow. The metro system, which had been delayed for years, is finally becoming operational. Districts that had been rural areas have become urban centers. District 2, which had contained mostly rice fields in the 1990s, is now a modern residential and business area. District 7, which had been undeveloped swampland, is now home to Phu My Hung, a modern planned community. The economy has boomed. By 2020, Ho Chi Minh City had become Vietnam's economic powerhouse, contributing about 23% of the national GDP. The retail sector has exploded. Before shopping malls had appeared, people had shopped in traditional markets. Now, modern malls are everywhere. The city has also become a tech hub. Many startups and tech companies have established themselves here. However, rapid development has brought challenges. Before the population had grown so quickly, the city had managed its resources better. Now, it faces issues like flooding, pollution, and strained infrastructure. Despite challenges, Ho Chi Minh City continues to be Vietnam's most dynamic and prosperous city.",

By the 1990s, after the government had opened the economy, foreign investment began flowing in. The country that had struggled economically started experiencing impressive growth. Cities have changed beyond recognition. Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, which had been relatively undeveloped, are now modern metropolises. Before skyscrapers had been built, low-rise buildings dominated city skylines. Now, modern high-rises and commercial centers are everywhere. Infrastructure has improved dramatically. Before new roads and bridges had been constructed, transportation had been difficult. Now, highways connect major cities, and metro systems are being developed. Technology has revolutionized daily life. Before the internet had become widespread, communication had been limited. Now, most Vietnamese use smartphones and social media. The economy has grown impressively. By 2020, Vietnam had become a middle-income country and a major manufacturing hub. Companies that had never considered Vietnam now invest heavily here. Education has advanced significantly. Before more universities had been established, few people had accessed higher education. Now, millions of students attend universities annually. However, challenges remain. Rapid development has brought environmental problems, income inequality, and pressure on infrastructure. Despite these issues, Vietnam's transformation has been remarkable. A country that had been devastated by war has become one of Southeast Asia's most dynamic economies.",

Visit Hanoi, the capital, to experience the Old Quarter and try authentic street food. Don't miss Ha Long Bay - the limestone islands are breathtaking. You should spend at least a night on a cruise. In central Vietnam, explore Hue, the former imperial capital. The Citadel is a must-see. Continue to Hoi An, an ancient town famous for lanterns and tailors. The beaches nearby are beautiful. In the south, Ho Chi Minh City offers a modern urban experience. Visit the Cu Chi Tunnels to learn about Vietnam War history. The Mekong Delta is worth exploring - take a boat through the waterways. When planning your itinerary, remember that Vietnam is a long country. Internal flights save time. Book accommodation in advance, especially during peak season. Try local cuisine - Vietnamese food is delicious and cheap. Pho, banh mi, and fresh spring rolls are must-tries. Respect local customs and dress modestly when visiting temples. Vietnamese people are friendly and helpful. Learn a few basic Vietnamese phrases - locals appreciate the effort.

The terraces are breathtaking, especially during the harvest season. We went on an excursion to Cat Cat Village to learn about the H'mong ethnic minority. The people were friendly and showed us their traditional crafts. We also visited Fansipan, the highest mountain in Vietnam. We took a cable car to the top - the view was amazing. In the town, we explored the local market where vendors sell handmade souvenirs and fresh produce. The food was delicious - we tried grilled corn and sticky rice. The weather was cool and foggy, very different from the heat in Hanoi. We stayed for three days, which was enough to see the main attractions.

      title: "Sustainable Tourism",
      passage: "Tourism is one of the world's largest industries, bringing economic benefits but also environmental and social challenges. Sustainable tourism aims to minimize negative impacts while maximizing positive ones. The concept involves protecting the environment, respecting local cultures, and providing economic benefits to local communities. In Vietnam, tourism has grown rapidly. The country welcomed over 18 million international visitors in 2019. Popular destinations like Ha Long Bay, Hoi An, and the Mekong Delta attract millions annually. While tourism creates jobs and income, it also brings problems. Overcrowding damages natural sites. In Ha Long Bay, the increasing number of boats threatens the marine ecosystem. Ancient towns like Hoi An struggle with the pressure of too many tourists. The authenticity of local culture can be lost when traditions are commercialized solely for tourist entertainment. Environmental issues include pollution, waste, and strain on water resources. Hotels and restaurants in tourist areas produce large amounts of waste. Beaches suffer from plastic pollution. To promote sustainable tourism, several measures are needed. Governments should limit visitor numbers at sensitive sites to prevent overcrowding. The entry fee system can help - money collected should fund conservation. Tourists should be educated about responsible behavior. They should respect local customs, avoid littering, and support local businesses rather than international chains. Eco-tourism offers an alternative. This type of tourism focuses on experiencing nature responsibly. Activities like bird watching, hiking, and staying in eco-lodges have minimal environmental impact. Community-based tourism is another approach. Tourists stay with local families, eat traditional food, and learn authentic culture. This provides direct income to communities. Vietnam has potential to develop sustainable tourism. The country's natural beauty and rich culture attract visitors seeking authentic experiences. If managed properly, tourism can bring prosperity while preserving Vietnam's heritage for future generations.",

      example: "The Mekong Delta is one of Vietnam's most fascinating regions. Located in southern Vietnam, the delta is formed by the Mekong River as it flows into the South China Sea. The area is often called 'the rice bowl of Vietnam' because it produces a huge amount of rice and fruit. The landscape is unique, with an intricate network of rivers, canals, and islands. Life revolves around the water. People travel by boat, live in houses on stilts, and work in fields that flood seasonally. A trip to the Mekong Delta offers unforgettable experiences. Visitors can explore the famous floating markets where vendors sell produce from boats. The markets are busiest early in the morning. You can visit fruit orchards and taste tropical fruits like rambutan, longan, and dragon fruit. The homestay experience is popular - staying with a local family gives insight into delta life. You can try traditional food, learn to cook Vietnamese dishes, and listen to don ca tai tu, the region's traditional music. The Mekong Delta faces challenges from climate change and development. Rising sea levels threaten the low-lying land. However, efforts are being made to promote sustainable tourism that benefits local communities. I recommend visiting the Mekong Delta if you want to see a different side of Vietnam. The peaceful rural life, friendly people, and beautiful waterways make it a destination worth experiencing.

If they share their experiences, you'll gain valuable insights. If possible, do internships to test careers. If you try different fields, you'll know what suits you. Don't rush the decision.

      passage: "The world of work is changing rapidly due to technology, globalization, and demographic shifts. Understanding these changes helps in career planning. Automation and artificial intelligence are transforming industries. Many routine jobs will be automated. If you work in a job involving repetitive tasks, it might be at risk. However, new jobs are being created. If technology advances, demand for data scientists, AI specialists, and cybersecurity experts will grow. If you develop skills in these areas, you'll have good prospects. The gig economy is expanding. More people work as freelancers or contractors rather than traditional employees. If you value flexibility, freelancing might appeal to you. However, it lacks the security of permanent employment. If you choose this path, you must manage finances carefully. Remote work is becoming normal. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend. If you work remotely, you can live anywhere. This offers freedom but requires self-discipline. If companies continue embracing remote work, traditional offices might become less common. Lifelong learning is essential. If you had stopped learning after formal education, your skills would become outdated. Technology evolves quickly. If you don't keep learning, you'll fall behind. Successful professionals continuously update their knowledge. Soft skills are increasingly important. If you can think critically, communicate effectively, and adapt to change, you'll thrive. These skills can't be automated. If robots could do everything, human creativity and emotional intelligence would still be valuable. Career paths are becoming less linear. People change careers multiple times. If you had told someone 50 years ago that people would have five different careers, they might not have believed you. But it's normal now. If you discover your chosen field doesn't suit you, changing is okay. Green jobs are growing. As societies address climate change, demand for environmental specialists, renewable energy engineers, and sustainability consultants increases. If you're passionate about the environment, these fields offer purpose and prospects. For young people planning careers, flexibility is key. If you had a crystal ball showing the future, planning would be easy. Since you don't, develop transferable skills that work across fields. If you can adapt, learn quickly, and solve problems, you'll succeed regardless of how work evolves.",

If I hadn't watched my grandfather receive excellent medical care, I might not have chosen this path. But that experience showed me how important doctors are. To become a doctor, I need excellent academic results. If I don't study hard now, I won't get into medical school. Medical school is highly competitive. If I had known how difficult it would be earlier, I might have been intimidated. But I'm determined to succeed. Besides academics, I need to develop other qualities. If I want to be a good doctor, I must be compassionate and patient. I volunteer at a local health clinic to gain experience. If I didn't do this, I wouldn't understand what medical work really involves. I'm also learning English seriously. If I master English, I can access international medical research and possibly study abroad. If I could study in a developed country, I would gain valuable experience. The journey won't be easy. Medical training takes many years. If I weren't truly passionate, I couldn't endure it. There will be long hours, difficult exams, and emotional challenges. If I face setbacks, I'll remember my motivation. Looking ahead, I have specific goals. If I become a doctor, I want to work in rural areas where healthcare is limited. Many doctors prefer cities. If everyone chose the easy path, rural communities would suffer. I want to make a difference where I'm needed most. If I had to choose between a high-paying city job and serving people in need, I'd choose the latter. I understand this career path is challenging. If it were easy, everyone would do it. But if I can help even one person live a healthier life, it will all be worthwhile. With dedication and hard work, I believe I can achieve my dream of becoming a doctor who truly makes a difference.",
